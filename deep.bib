downbeat location and pattern complexity in rhythmical patterns. Though
derived from several existing models, the NPOS model is particularly
effective at making correct predictions while at the same time having
low complexity. In this paper, the details of the model are explored
and a comparison is made to existing models.  Several datasets are used
to examine the complexity predictions of the model. Special attention
is paid to the model's ability to account for the effects of musical
experience on beat induction.},

Not only are they more biologically plausible than previous artificial RNNs,           they also outperformed them on many artificially generated sequential processing tasks.           This encouraged us to apply LSTM to more realistic problems, such as the recognition of spoken digits.           Without any modification of the underlying algorithm, we achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model           (HMM) based recognisers on both the TIDIGITS and TI46 speech corpora.           We conclude that LSTM should be further investigated as a biologically plausible basis for a bottom-up,           neural net-based approach to speech recognition.},

We measure its performance on a spoken digit         identification task, where the data was spike-encoded in such a way that classifying the utterances became a         difficult challenge in non-linear timewarping. We find that LSTM gives greatly superior results to an SNN found in the

	Abstract = {We present curiosity-driven, autonomous acquisition of tactile exploratory skills on a biomimetic robot finger equipped with an array of microelectromechanical touch sensors. Instead of building tailored algorithms for solving a specific tactile task, we employ a more general curiosity-driven reinforcement learning approach that autonomously learns a set of motor skills in absence of an explicit teacher signal. In this approach, the acquisition of skills is driven by the information content of the sensory input signals relative to a learner that aims at representing sensory inputs using fewer and fewer computational resources. We show that, from initially random exploration of its environment, the robotic system autonomously develops a small set of basic motor skills that lead to different kinds of tactile input. Next, the system learns how to exploit the learned motor skills to solve supervised texture classification tasks. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous acquisition of tactile skills on physical robotic platforms through curiosity-driven reinforcement learning, overcomes typical difficulties of engineered solutions for active tactile exploration and underactuated control, and provides a basis for studying developmental learning through intrinsic motivation in robots.},

	Abstract = {Neutral genotype-phenotype mappings can be observed in
                 natural evolution and are often used in evolutionary
                 computation. In this article, important aspects of such
                 encodings are analysed. First, it is shown that in the
                 absence of external control neutrality allows a
                 variation of the search distribution independent of
                 phenotypic changes. In particular, neutrality is
                 necessary for self-adaptation, which is used in a
                 variety of algorithms from all main paradigms of
                 evolutionary computation to increase efficiency.
                 Second, the average number of fitness evaluations
                 needed to find a desirable (e.g., optimally adapted)
                 genotype depending on the number of desirable genotypes
                 and the cardinality of the genotype space is derived.
                 It turns out that this number increases only marginally
                 when neutrality is added to an encoding presuming that
                 the fraction of desirable genotypes stays constant and
                 that the number of these genotypes is not too small.},

@article{boddy-dean:1994a,
	Abstract = {We are interested in the problem faced by an
                 agent with limited computational capabilities, embedded
                 in a complex environment with other agents and
                 processes not under its control. Careful management of
                 computational resources is important for complex
                 problem-solving tasks in which the time spent in
                 decision making affects the quality of the responses
                 generated by a system. This paper describes an approach
                 to designing systems that are capable of taking their
                 own computational resources into consideration during
                 planning and problem solving. In particular, we address
                 the design of systems that manage their computational
                 resources by using expectations about the performance
                 of decision-making procedures and preferences over the
                 outcomes resulting from applying those procedures. Our
                 approach is called deliberation scheduling.
                 Deliberation scheduling involves the explicit
                 allocation of computational resources to
                 decision-making procedures based on the expected effect
                 of those allocations on the system's performance.},
